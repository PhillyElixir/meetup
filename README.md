# Philly Elixir Meetup

Philadelphia-based professional networking group dedicated to programming in Erlang and Elixir.

## Connect with the group

- [Meetup Group][meetup]

- [@mixphilly][twitter]

## Help plan the meetups

Because the Elixir community in Philly is nascent, we're focusing on growing our collective Elixir experience by coding rather than talks.

Check out our [Code Ideas board][code-ideas] to contribute and discuss ideas for coding exercises and tasks we can do when we meet.

If you have a talk you'd like to give, email mike@promptworks.com.
